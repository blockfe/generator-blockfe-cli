# generator-blockfe-cli

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/generator-blockfe-cli.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-blockfe-cli) 

## Background

Help you to quickly start a project based on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

In my work, I often need to start a tiny demo quickly to

- try a npm lib by `import`
- test/try a webpack plugin or loader
- write a demo page for some features
- ……

Without configuring Wepack, `generator-blockfe-cli` makes these more simple.

## Install

Install Yeoman and generator-blockfe-cli (we assume you have pre-installed node.js).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-blockfe-cli
```

## Usage

```bash
yo blockfe-cli
```
